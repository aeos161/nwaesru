  Hello. We are looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we
  have devised a test.
  There is a message hidden in this image.
  Find it and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to
  meeting the few who will make it all the way through.
  Good Luck.

  Here is a book code.  To find the book, and more information, go to
  From here on out, we will cryptographically sign all messages with this key.
  It is available on the mit keyservers.  Key ID, as posted in
  Patience is a virtue.
  Good luck.
  The key has always been right in front of your eyes.
  This isn't the quest for the Holy Grail.  Stop making
  it more difficult than it is.
  Good luck.

  Very good. You have done well. There are three prime numbers associated with
  the original final jpg image.
  3301 is one of them. You will have to find the other two.
  Multiply all three of these numbers together and add a .com to find the next step.
  Good luck. Goodbye.

  You've shared too much to this point.  We want the best,
  not the followers.  Thus, the first few there will receive
  the prize.
  Good luck.
  Congratulations!

  Here is a message that has been encrypted with RSA the Crypt RSA Perl module
  available in CPAN

  Here is the public key used to encrypt it. Note that it has a low bit modulus
  and is therefore breakable
  The encrypted message is a number. Break the decryption key, then come back
  to this same URL and enter the decrypted message to continue. Each person who
  has come this far has received a unique message encrypted with a unique key.
  You are not to collaborate. Sharing your message or key will result in not
  receiving the next step.
  There is a second chance to get your own RSA message and key. Follow the
  Numbers dot TK hint to find it.
  There are many fake messages out there. Only messages signed with public key
  ID are valid.
  Good luck.
  very good you have proven to be most dedicated to come this

  Hello.
  We have now found the individuals we sought. Thus our month-long journey ends.
  For now.
  Thank you for your dedication and effort. If you were unable to complete the
  test, or did not recieve an email, do not despair.
  There will be more opportunities like this one.
  Thank you all.
