  IT IS NOT AN EASY TRIP, BUT FOR THOSE WHO

  A KOAN
  A MAN DECIDED TO GO AND STUDY WITH A MASTER.
  HE WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE MASTER
  WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?
  ASKED THE MASTER.
  THE STUDENT TOLD THE MASTER HIS NAME.
  THAT IS NOT WHO YOU ARE THAT IS ONLY WHAT YOU ARE CALLED.
  WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE? HE ASKED
  AGAIN.
  THE MAN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT, AND REPLIED
  I AM A PROFESSOR.
  THAT IS WHAT YOU DO, NOT WHO YOU ARE
  REPLIED THE MASTER. WHO ARE
  YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?
  CONFUSED, THE MAN THOUGHT SOME MORE.
  FINALLY, HE ANSWERED, I AM A HUMAN BEING.
  THAT IS ONLY YOUR SPECIES, NOT WHO YOU ARE.
  WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?
  ASKED THE MASTER AGAIN.
  AFTER A MOMENT OF THOUGHT, THE PROFESSOR REPLIED
  I AM A CONSCIOUSNESS INHABITING AN ARBITRARY BODY.
  THAT IS MERELY WHAT YOU ARE NOT WHO YOU ARE
  WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?
  THE MAN WAS GETTING IRRITATED. I AM, HE STARTED,
  BUT HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY,
  SO HE TRAILED OFF. AFTER A LONG PAUSE THE MASTER REPLIED
  THEN YOU ARE WELCOME TO COME STUDY.
  AN INSTRUCTION
  DO FOUR UNREASONABLE THINGS EACH DAY.
  TO BELIEVE TRUTH IS TO DESTROY POSSIBILITY
  THE LOSS OF DIVINITY
  THE CIRCUMFERENCE PRACTICES THREE BEHAVIORS WHICH CAUSE THE LOSS OF DIVINITY.
  CONSUMPTION
  WE CONSUME TOO MUCH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING TWO ERRORS WITHIN THE
  DECEPTION.
  WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OR THERE IS NOT ENOUGH
  MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH PRESERVING
  ADHERENCE
  WE FOLLOW DOGMA SO THAT WE CAN BELONG AND BE RIGHT.
  OR WE FOLLOW REASON SO WE CAN BELONG AND BE RIGHT.
  THERE IS NOTHING TO BE RIGHT ABOUT.
  TO BELONG IS DEATH.
  IT IS THE BEHAVIORS OF CONSUMPTION, PRESERVATION, AND ADHERENCE THAT HAVE US
  LOSE OUR PRIMALITY AND THUS OUR DIVINITY
  SOME WISDOM AMASS GREAT WEALTH. NEVER BECOME ATTACHED TO WHAT YOU OWN.
  BE PREPARED TO DESTROY ALL THAT
  YOU OWN
  AN INSTRUCTION PROGRAM YOUR MIND. PROGRAM REALITY

  A KOAN DURING A LESSION THE MASTER EXPLAINED THE I
  THE I IS THE VOICE OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE HE SAID WHEN ASKED BY A STUDENT TO
  EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT, THE MASTER SAID IT IS A VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD
  I DONT HAVE A VOICE IN MY HEAD THOUGHT THE STUDENT AND HE RAISED HIS HAND TO
  TELL THE MASTER.THE MASTER STOPPED THE STUDENT AND SAID THEVOICE THAT JUST
  SAID YOU HAVE NO VOICE IN YOUR HEAD IS THE I
  AND THE STUDENTS WERE ENLLIGHTENED
  AN INSTRUCTION

  IT IS THE DUTY OF EUERY PILGRIM TO SEEK OUT THIS PAGE.
